    <h2>Buttered Noodles Ingredients</h2>
    
    <p>Believe it or not, you can make this incredibly simple dish with just four ingredients: </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Noodles</strong>: This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan</strong>: Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong>: Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
    </ul>
